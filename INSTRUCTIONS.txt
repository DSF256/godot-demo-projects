*** JUMP BOT ***

Welcome to Jump Bot, soldier.
We have engineered a brand new war machine that will revolutionize remote combat: Jump Bot.
We have set up some training exercises for you

*** CONTROLS ***
Despite being a robust war machine, the Jump Bot is easy to control.
It would do you good to familiarize yourself with how this machine operates, soldier.
* Up Arrow = Jump
* Left Arrow = Move left
* Right Arrow = Move right
* Spacebar = Shoot projectile
** Press the spacebar repeatedly in order to hover in the air for a short time
* Escape = Pause

*** GAMEPLAY ***
The simulation environment we have set up is set in the middle of a jungle wilderness in an undisclosed location.
In each level, you will find 40 coins and 4 orbs scattered throughout the terrain.
The coins are optional, but they are necessary in order to get extra lives.
Collect all 4 orbs to complete the level.
Right now, our simulation budget only allowed us to create two levels to test our Jump Bot on, so make the most of them.

*** ENEMIES ***
In each level, there are 4 mechanical bugs that have been engineered to destroy the Jump Bot.
A single blast with the Jump Bot's laser turret will disable them quite nicely.
Thanks to our engineers' hard work, the Jump Bot can sustain up to 4 hits before succumbing to damage.
Oh, and I probably shouldn't have to tell YOU this, soldier, but don't fall off the dang level.
Our budget didn't allow us to buy a crane to scoop you off the jungle floor, after all.

And that's it.
We have confidence that Jump Bot is much more sophisticated than it seems.
Go out there are prove us right, soldier.
